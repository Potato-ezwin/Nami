## Why

Most commonly used Minecraft clients are paid, closed-source, and obfuscated. This makes them difficult to audit or trust and in some cases, they may include backdoors or malicious code.

This project was started as a clean, open-source alternative. It aims to be transparent, secure, and easy to extend, without relying on potentially unsafe third-party clients.

## Requirements
